# Law-Review-Submission-Template

This repository hosts a template for law review submissions (i.e., submitting an Article, Essay, or Note to a law review for potential publication), which may be somewhat foreign if this is your first legal publication, and especially if you're coming from a [non-legal background](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/blog/2013-12/index.html). Surprisingly, not many templates exist for this type of submissionâ€”so here's a starter! And since you might be asking: yes, the law review more than likely wants the submission as a Word file. Feel free to download and modify; comments and pull requests are always welcome!


Notable points include: 


- single spaced lines
- 0 inch left and right indentation (found in paragraph settings in Microsoft Word)
- justify text 
- author names excluded for anonymity 
- font as Times new Roman in 12-point above the line and 10-point below the line
- small caps used in Introduction, Part headings, and Conclusion
- full caps and bold used on title
- example cross-reference footnotes (makes later adjustments easier) 
- document is named with simple versioning (title__versionNumber__authorInitials)
- cross referenced footnotes (infra and supra) in below-the-line text
